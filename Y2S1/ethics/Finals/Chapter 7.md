1.  Software development methodology
2.  Software testing
3.  Quality assurance and standards
4.  Software quality and assurance techniques

#### **1. Software development methodology**
*   A **software development methodology** is a tried-and-true work procedure that helps system analysts, designers, and project managers produce high-quality software in a managed and orderly manner.
*   A **technique** describes the tasks in the development phase and the responsibilities for completing them. There are specific techniques for various functions, such as using a flowchart to record application logic.
*   **Examples of Software Development Methodologies:**
    *   **Agile:**
        *   A flexible, iterative approach.
        *   Emphasizes continuous delivery, customer feedback, and adapting to change.
        *   Breaks the project into small, manageable portions.
        *   Allows teams to adjust direction based on client feedback.
        *   Focuses on delivering functional product increments rapidly.
    *   **Waterfall:**
        *   A traditional, linear approach.
        *   Follows a strict sequence of phases: requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
        *   Each phase must be completed before moving to the next, with little room for revisiting earlier phases.
        *   Suits projects with well-defined requirements where changes are unlikely.
*   Identifying and eliminating a defect early in the development process (e.g., during requirements definition) can cost up to **100 times less** than removing it after the software has been shipped.
*   If a flaw is discovered later, it requires **rework**, and the **costs of communicating and correcting the mistake** are higher.
*   Software engineers strive to find and eliminate mistakes early to save money and **increase software quality**.
*   A product with underlying flaws that cause damage can lead to a **product warranty lawsuit**. Failing to design applications carefully can result in significant liability exposure.

#### **2. Software testing**
*   **Software testing** is the method of evaluating the functionality of a software program to determine if it meets the required specifications and to identify bugs.
*   **Types of testing methods:**
    *   **Manual testing:** Manually evaluating software to see what is working and what is not. It involves verifying all functionality listed in the specification documents, often from the end user's perspective.
    *   **Automation Testing:** Using an automated tool to find bugs. Testers run test scripts that produce test results automatically.
    *   **Dynamic Testing:** Testing a finished unit of software by entering test data and matching the results with predicted outcomes. It is divided into two types:
        *   **Black-box testing:** Treats the software as a "black box" with unexplained internal workings. The unit is tested based on predicted input and output actions. The tester does not need to know the code's composition and is often someone other than the author.
        *   **White-box testing:** Considers the software as a system with known internal workings. It involves understanding the logic of the program unit and testing all feasible logic pathways. Each program statement must be executed at least once.

#### **3. Quality assurance and standards**
*   **Quality assurance (QA)** refers to approaches used during production to ensure a product's consistent service.
*   **Quality** can be summarized as "fit for use or purpose," which means satisfying consumers' desires in terms of functionality, style, efficiency, longevity, and price.
*   **Assurance** is a statement that a good or service can perform well and in accordance with standards.
*   Software testing QA is a method for assuring the quality of software products or services.
*   QA aims to make the software development process more **dependable and competitive**.
*   The **PDCA cycle** (or Deming cycle) is used in QA:
    *   **Plan:** Create process-related objectives.
    *   **Do:** Implement the plan, and develop and test processes.
    *   **Check:** Monitor procedures to see if they meet objectives.
    *   **Act:** Take necessary measures to improve processes.
*   These processes are **repeated on a regular basis** to ensure operations are evaluated and improved.
*   An organization uses QA to verify that a product is developed and delivered properly, which helps **reduce the number of problems and faults** in the final product.

#### **4. Software quality and assurance techniques**
*   A high-quality product **fulfills the expectations of its consumers**, often by meeting the requirements of the Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) guide.
*   **Software product quality methods include:**
    *   **Scalable:** Able to operate on a range of operating systems and devices.
    *   **Usability:** All types of consumers can conveniently use the system's features.
    *   **Reusability:** Components can be easily replicated to produce new applications.
    *   **Correctness:** The SRS document's specifications have been applied properly.
    *   **Maintainability:** Glitches can be easily fixed, new tasks can be easily applied, and functionalities can be easily changed.
*   A **quality control scheme** is a common way for businesses to ensure high-quality products.
*   **Individual responsibilities and managerial structure** are components of a quality system:
    *   The entire organization is responsible for the quality scheme.
    *   The quality scheme should have the **approval of top management**. If not supported at a high level, some employees may view it negatively.
*   **Activities in the quality management system:**
    *   Project auditing
    *   Quality system review
    *   Development of principles, procedures, and protocols
    *   Production of publications for senior management summarizing the success of the quality system.
