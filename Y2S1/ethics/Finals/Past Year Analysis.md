### High-Level Structural and Thematic Similarities

1.  **Consistent Four-Question Structure:** Both exams consist of exactly four main questions, with each question worth a total of 25 marks.
2.  **Predictable Thematic Questions:** Each of the four questions consistently maps to a specific core topic from the course syllabus. A student could reliably predict which chapter or topic area will be covered in each question number.
3.  **Use of Case Studies:** Questions 2 and 4 in both exams are based on short, practical case studies that require students to apply theoretical knowledge to a fictional business scenario.
4.  **Mix of Knowledge and Application:** Both papers test a combination of rote memorization (defining terms, listing steps) and higher-order thinking (applying principles, justifying opinions, providing examples).

### Breakdown of Similarities by Thematic Area

The two exams are remarkably similar when compared topic by topic. The questions almost seem like different versions of the same template.

#### **Theme 1: Foundational Ethics and Cybercrime (Question 1 in both papers)**

This question consistently acts as an introduction, covering the basics of ethics and the landscape of cybercrime.

| October 2024 Paper | January 2025 Paper | Analysis of Similarity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Q1(a):** Discuss differences among **morals, ethics, and law** with examples. | **Q1(a):** Distinguish between **morals and ethics** in the context of IT with examples. | **Direct Overlap:** The core concepts of morals and ethics are tested in both exams. |
| **Q1(b):** Describe the **FIVE steps in ethical decision-making.** | - | This is a minor difference, but the topic of ethical frameworks is part of this section. |
| **Q1(d):** Discuss active attacks: **trojan horse, DDoS attack, rootkit.** | **Q1(d):** Explain THREE examples of **active security attacks.** | **Direct Overlap:** Both exams require students to know and explain specific types of active attacks. |
| **Q1(c) & (e):** Define "exploits" and the objective of a "passive attack". | **Q1(b) & (c):** Define "cybercrime" and describe factors contributing to vulnerabilities. | **Thematic Overlap:** Both questions test fundamental concepts related to cyber threats and vulnerabilities. |

**Conclusion for Theme 1:** Question 1 is predictably about foundational ethics and cybercrime definitions/examples. Students must be able to differentiate morals/ethics and describe specific security attacks.

#### **Theme 2: Security Risk Management and Principles (Question 2 in both papers)**

This question focuses on how an organization should practically manage its IT security, using a case study.

| October 2024 Paper | January 2025 Paper | Analysis of Similarity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Q2 (Case):** A retail business upgrading its POS system needs a **security risk assessment.** | **Q2 (Case):** A cloud storage provider that suffered a breach needs to implement **IT security policies.** | **Thematic Overlap:** Both cases deal with a company needing to improve its security posture. One focuses on the *assessment* phase, the other on the *response* phase, but they are two sides of the same coin. |
| **Q2(a), (b), (c):** Why risk assessment is important, the **8 steps** of the process, and identifying the main asset. | **Q2(a), (b):** The purpose of an IT Security Policy and **four examples** of such policies. | **Conceptual Link:** Both test the formal processes and documentation an organization uses for security. |
| **Q2(d):** Discuss the **THREE CIA triad principles** and apply them to the case. | **Q2(c):** Assess the **Confidentiality and Availability** principles of the CIA triad and apply them to the case. | **Direct Overlap:** The **CIA Triad** is a guaranteed topic in this question. Students must be able to define and apply it. |
| - | **Q2(d):** Discuss the **FOUR pillars of Trustworthy Computing** and apply them. | **Thematic Overlap:** This question expands on the "principles" part of security, linking directly to the concepts covered in the CIA Triad. |

**Conclusion for Theme 2:** Question 2 will be a case study on security management. The **CIA Triad is a central, recurring concept**. Students should also be prepared to discuss risk assessment processes, IT security policies, and the principles of Trustworthy Computing.

#### **Theme 3: Software Development and Quality Assurance (Question 3 in both papers)**

This question is consistently about the software development lifecycle, with a strong focus on testing and quality.

| October 2024 Paper | January 2025 Paper | Analysis of Similarity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Q3(a):** Agree/disagree that fixing defects early **costs less than fixing them later.** | **Q3(d):** Identify the impact of discovering a flaw **later in the production process.** | **Direct Overlap:** The economic impact of when a defect is found is a key, recurring point. |
| **Q3(b):** Examine **black-box and white-box testing** with examples. | **Q3(b):** Examine the differences between **black-box and white-box testing** with scenarios. | **Direct Overlap:** This is a guaranteed topic. Students must know the two main dynamic testing methods. |
| **Q3(c):** Discuss the **PDCA cycle** in quality assurance. | **Q3(c):** Explain the purpose of the **Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle** and its stages. | **Direct Overlap:** The PDCA cycle for quality assurance is another guaranteed topic. |
| **Q3(d):** Describe a characteristic of good software. | **Q3(a):** Determine two goals of software testing. | **Thematic Overlap:** Both questions touch upon the definition and goals of high-quality software and testing. |

**Conclusion for Theme 3:** Question 3 is highly predictable. It will cover the cost of defects, black-box vs. white-box testing, and the PDCA cycle.

#### **Theme 4: Intellectual Property (Question 4 in both papers)**

This question focuses entirely on Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), again using a case study.

| October 2024 Paper | January 2025 Paper | Analysis of Similarity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Q4 (Case):** A developer creates an encryption algorithm. | **Q4 (Case):** A company launches an AI shopping portal and a competitor copies its design. | **Thematic Overlap:** Both cases revolve around the creation of a unique digital asset that needs legal protection. |
| **Q4(a):** Examine why **IPR is important** to the developer. | **Q4(a):** Determine the **importance of protecting IPR** and its contribution to competitive advantage. | **Direct Overlap:** The fundamental importance of IPR is a core part of this question. |
| **Q4(b):** Suggest **TWO suitable types of IPR** for the algorithm (e.g., patent, trade secret). | **Q4(b):** Interpret **four types of IP protections** (Patents, Copyrights, Trademarks, Trade Secrets) and how they could be applied. | **Direct Overlap:** Both questions require students to know the different types of IPR and how to apply them to a specific creation. |
| **Q4(c):** Explain the **FIVE spectrums of trademarks.** | **Q4(c):** Explain types of **cybersquatting** (Reverse-cybersquatting, Typosquatting, Name jacking, Identity theft). | **Conceptual Similarity:** While the specific topics differ, both are "deep dives" into a specific issue related to IP. This shows that students need detailed knowledge of sub-topics within the broader IPR chapter. |

**Conclusion for Theme 4:** Question 4 will be a case study about protecting a digital creation. Students must be able to explain the importance of IPR, identify and justify the use of different IPR types, and know specific details about related issues like trademarks or cybersquatting.

### Summary of Key Similarities

*   **Core Topics are Guaranteed:** The four pillars tested are: (1) Ethics & Cybercrime Basics, (2) Security Management & Principles (CIA Triad), (3) Software Quality & Testing (PDCA, Black/White Box), and (4) Intellectual Property Rights.
*   **Application is Key:** Rote memorization is not enough. The consistent use of case studies in Q2 and Q4 means students must be able to apply concepts to real-world scenarios.
*   **Predictable Question Format:** The structure `Define -> Explain -> Apply` is common across both papers.
