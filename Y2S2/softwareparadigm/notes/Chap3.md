# Chapter 3(a): Introduction to Software Requirement

### Types of Requirements
* **User Requirements:** High-level abstract statements in natural language for users and managers.
* **System Requirements:** Detailed descriptions of functions, services, and constraints used by developers (functional specifications).

### Functional vs. Non-Functional
* **Functional Requirements:** Statements of services the system should provide, how it reacts to inputs, and how it behaves.
    * *Example:* User authentication, search functionality.
* **Non-Functional Requirements:** Describe *how* the software performs tasks (quality attributes, constraints) rather than *what* it does.
    * *Types:* Product (usability, reliability), Organizational (delivery, standards), External (legislative, ethical).

### Natural Language Problems
* **Lack of Clarity:** Ambiguity, wordiness.
* **Requirement Confusion:** Mixing functional, non-functional, and design info.
* **Requirement Amalgamation:** Several requirements expressed as one.
* **Solutions:** Structured natural language, design description languages, graphical notations, mathematical specifications.

### Software Requirements Document (SRS)
* **Definition:** The official statement of what is required of the system developer. It is NOT a design document.
* **Structure:** Preface, Introduction, Glossary, User Requirements, System Architecture, System Requirements Specification, System Models, System Evolution, Appendices, Index.

# Chapter 3(b): Requirement Engineering Process

### Requirement Engineering (RE)
* **Definition:** The process of identifying, eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing stakeholder needs.
* **Process Steps:** Elicitation, Definition, Analysis, Prototyping, Review, Specification, Agreement.

### Feasibility Studies
* **Technical:** Is the project technically possible?
* **Economic:** Is it cost-effective?
* **Legal:** Does it comply with regulations?
* **Operational:** How hard is it to maintain/manage?
* **Scheduling:** Can realistic deadlines be met?

### Elicitation & Analysis
* **Goal:** Deriving system requirements by working with stakeholders.
* **Stakeholders:** Any person/group affected by the system.
* **Techniques:**
    * **Interviews:** One-on-one or group discussions.
    * **Questionnaires:** Distributing questions to large groups.
    * **Observations:** Passive or active observation of tasks.
    * **Scenarios:** Real-life examples (e.g., Use Cases).
    * **Prototyping:** Quick implementation for feedback.

### Organization & Validation
* **Classification:** Organizing unstructured requirements into coherent clusters and removing overlaps.
* **Prioritization:** Prioritizing requirements and resolving conflicts.
* **Specification:** Writing down the user and system requirements in a document.
* **Validation:** Ensuring requirements meet customer needs via validity, consistency, completeness, realism, and verifiability checks.
