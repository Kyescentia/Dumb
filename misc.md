### **1. Introduction and Logistics**
*   **Purpose:** The workshop aims to help students create a compelling resume. Participation is tracked for university credit (GA points).
*   **Audience:** The workshop is attended by a mix of Diploma and Bachelor's Degree students from various IT-related fields (Computer Science, Software Engineering, Data Science).
*   **Format:** The session is designed to be interactive, with the speaker encouraging students to work on their resumes during the workshop and submit them for feedback.

### **2. The Importance of a Resume in the IT Industry**
*   **The 6-Second Rule:** Recruiters spend an average of only six seconds initially scanning a resume. It must make an immediate positive impact.
*   **Resume vs. CV:** A **Resume** is a concise (1-2 pages) summary for industry jobs, while a **CV (Curriculum Vitae)** is a more detailed document for academic positions. For internships and corporate jobs, a resume is required.
*   **First Impression:** Your resume is often the first and only impression a company has of you. A poorly crafted resume can lead to immediate rejection.

### **3. Understanding Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)**
*   **What it is:** ATS is software used by over 70% of companies to automatically scan, filter, and rank resumes based on keywords and formatting before a human ever sees them.
*   **How it Works:** The system parses resume text, extracts information, and matches it against the job description. Resumes with poor formatting, non-standard fonts, or a lack of relevant keywords are often filtered out.
*   **Key Takeaway:** Your resume must be optimized for both the ATS (machine) and the human recruiter.

### **4. Key Components of an Effective IT Resume**

**A. Contact Information & Header**
*   **Include:** Full Name, Phone Number, Professional Email, LinkedIn URL, and GitHub/Portfolio link.
*   **Tip:** For internships, use your university email to verify your student status. Use a personal, professional email for full-time job applications.
*   **University Name:** Use the full, correct name: "Tunku Abdul Rahman University of Management and Technology, Penang Branch."

**B. Professional Summary/Objective**
*   **Keep it brief (2-3 sentences):** Tailor it to the specific role.
*   **Be Specific:** Avoid generic terms like "hardworking" or "passionate." Instead, state your year of study, key technical skills, and what kind of role you are seeking.
*   **Example:** "Final year Diploma in Computer Science student proficient in Python, SQL, and cloud computing, seeking a software engineering internship to apply full-stack development skills."

**C. Technical Skills**
*   **Crucial Section:** This is one of the first things recruiters look for.
*   **Categorize:** Group skills into categories like **Programming Languages**, **Tools**, **Databases**, and **Frameworks**.
*   **Be Specific:** Instead of just "UI/UX Design," specify the tools you use, like "UI/UX Design (Figma)."
*   **Tailor Keywords:** Match the skills listed in your resume to the keywords in the job description.

**D. Education**
*   **Order:** List in reverse chronological order (most recent first).
*   **Details:** Include the full name of your degree/diploma, university, and expected graduation date.
*   **CGPA:** Include it if it's strong (e.g., above 3.0). It's better to be transparent.
*   **SPM:** Can be included for diploma students. For degree students, it's optional but some companies like to see it.

**E. Work/Internship Experience**
*   **Order:** List in reverse chronological order.
*   **Action Verbs:** Start each bullet point with a strong action verb in the past tense (e.g., *Developed, Optimized, Managed, Configured*).
*   **Quantify Achievements:** Where possible, use numbers to show impact (e.g., "Optimized SQL queries, reducing load time by 30%").
*   **No Experience?** Part-time jobs (even non-IT) can be listed to demonstrate responsibility and soft skills.

**F. Projects**
*   **Showcase Your Skills:** This is vital for showing practical application of your knowledge.
*   **Details:** Describe your Final Year Project (FYP) or significant mini-projects. Mention the technologies and tools used and the project's outcome.

**G. Certifications & Co-Curricular Activities**
*   **Certifications:** Include any online courses or professional certifications (e.g., from Coursera, AWS, Google).
*   **Co-Curricular:** List involvement in clubs, competitions, or leadership roles to highlight soft skills like teamwork, leadership, and communication.

### **5. Formatting and Final Tips (ATS-Friendly)**
*   **File Format:** Always save and submit your resume as a **PDF**.
*   **Layout:** Use a clean, simple, single-column layout. Avoid tables, columns, headers, and footers, as ATS can struggle to read them.
*   **Font:** Use a standard, easy-to-read font like **Arial** or **Calibri**. Avoid overly decorative fonts and Times New Roman, which can look dated.
*   **Length:** Aim for **one page**. This is the standard for students and fresh graduates.
*   **Proofread:** Check for grammar and spelling errors multiple times. Use tools like Grammarly or ask ChatGPT to review it.
*   **File Name:** Name your file professionally (e.g., `YourName_Resume_SoftwareIntern.pdf`).

### **Key Themes and Actionable Advice**

**1. The "Dual Audience" Strategy: Writing for Machines and Humans**

The most critical takeaway is that your resume has two audiences, and you must satisfy them in order:

*   **Audience 1: The Machine (ATS):** The first gatekeeper is the software. To pass this stage, your resume must be simple, keyword-rich, and easily parsable. This is why the speaker heavily emphasized using standard fonts, simple layouts, and avoiding complex graphics or tables.
*   **Audience 2: The Human (Recruiter):** Once your resume passes the ATS, a human reads it. This is where clarity, quantified achievements, and strong action verbs become vital. The human reader needs to quickly understand your value and potential. The design should be clean and professional to appeal to their aesthetic sense.

**2. The Resume as a Dynamic Marketing Document, Not a Static History File**

The speaker stressed that a resume is not a one-size-fits-all document you create once. It's a living document that must be:

*   **Tailored:** You should customize your resume for every single job application, matching the keywords and skills from the job description.
*   **Updated Regularly:** The speaker suggests updating it every six months or at least annually to reflect new skills and projects. This prevents a last-minute scramble when an opportunity arises.

### **Crucial Do's and Don'ts Distilled from the Workshop**

**Do:**

*   **Quantify Your Impact:** Instead of saying "Managed the club's social media," say "Increased social media engagement by 40% over six months by implementing a new content strategy." Numbers prove your effectiveness.
*   **Categorize Your Skills:** Grouping your technical skills (Languages, Tools, Databases) makes it much easier for recruiters to quickly assess your qualifications.
*   **Use Your University Email for Internships:** It immediately verifies you as a current student, which is what companies look for in interns.
*   **Ask for Permission:** Always ask lecturers for their consent before listing them as a reference. Sending them a copy of your resume is also a good practice.
*   **Maintain a Professional Online Presence:** Create a LinkedIn profile and clean up your GitHub. Recruiters will look you up.

**Don't:**

*   **Use Unprofessional Emails:** The speaker humorously but firmly warned against using old, informal emails like `hellokitty123` or `demonslayer`. Create a simple, professional one (e.g., `firstname.lastname@email.com`).
*   **Exaggerate or Lie:** While you should present yourself in the best light, do not claim skills you don't have. You will be tested on them during the interview. It's better to say "Beginner knowledge in Kotlin" than to list it as a core skill and be unable to answer questions.
*   **Use Overly Complex Visuals:** The speaker repeatedly warned against fancy templates with lots of graphics, tables, or columns that can confuse the ATS. Simplicity and clarity are key.
*   **Upload Company Work to Your Personal GitHub:** This was a critical warning. The speaker shared an anecdote about an intern who was almost terminated for uploading confidential company code to a public repository. This is a serious breach of intellectual property.
*   **Make the Recruiter Work Hard:** Don't use long, dense paragraphs. Use bullet points, clear headings, and a logical flow to make the information easy to find and digest in just a few seconds.

### **The Mindset Shift: From Student to Professional Candidate**

The entire workshop was an exercise in shifting the students' perspective from "completing a task" to "marketing a product"—with the product being themselves.

**1. The Shift from "What I Have Done" to "What I Can Do for You"**

*   **Student Mindset:** "I completed a course on database management."
*   **Professional Candidate Mindset (as taught in the workshop):** "Developed and optimized SQL queries to manage data, resulting in a 30% faster load time for a class project."

The speaker consistently pushed for this change. It’s not enough to list your experiences; you must frame them as **solutions and capabilities**. This demonstrates that you understand the employer's primary question: "How can this person add value to my team?"

**2. The Concept of Signal vs. Noise**

In a professional context, clarity is paramount. A recruiter has very little time and is scanning for clear signals of competence.

*   **Noise (What the speaker advised against):**
    *   Unprofessional emails (`hellokitty123`)
    *   Fancy, hard-to-read fonts and graphics
    *   Generic fluff words ("passionate," "hardworking")
    *   Long, unstructured paragraphs
    *   An outdated photo

*   **Signal (What the speaker promoted):**
    *   A clean, single-column, ATS-friendly format
    *   Specific, industry-standard keywords (Python, SQL, AWS, Figma)
    *   Quantified achievements (numbers and percentages)
    *   A professional LinkedIn and a curated GitHub profile

The lesson here is to be ruthless in eliminating anything that distracts from your core value proposition. Every element on your resume should be a strong, clear signal of your fitness for the role.

**3. Demonstrating "Professional Maturity" Before You Have a Profession**

Companies aren't just hiring for technical skills; they are also assessing your potential to be a good employee. The resume is your first test of professional maturity.

*   **Signs of Immaturity:** A resume with typos, an unprofessional email, or an inappropriate photo suggests a lack of attention to detail and an unawareness of professional norms.
*   **Signs of Maturity:** A well-proofread, tailored, and professionally formatted resume shows that you are serious, detail-oriented, and already understand the basics of professional communication. By following the speaker's advice, you are signaling that you will require less hand-holding as an intern or new hire.

**4. The Resume as the Hub of Your Personal Brand**

The speaker didn't just talk about the A4 document. He implicitly encouraged students to see their resume as the central hub connecting to a wider professional identity.

*   **The Hub:** The resume.
*   **The Spokes:**
    *   Your **LinkedIn profile** (where you can elaborate on experiences).
    *   Your **GitHub profile** (where you can prove your coding skills with actual projects).
    *   Your **portfolio** (if you have design work).

By including links to these platforms, you are not just telling the recruiter about your skills; you are inviting them to **verify** them. This transparency builds immense credibility and is a hallmark of a confident, modern candidate.

In essence, the workshop's ultimate lesson was about **strategic self-presentation**. It taught students to move beyond simply listing facts and instead to build a compelling narrative that answers an employer's needs, passes through modern technological filters, and signals their readiness for the professional world.
