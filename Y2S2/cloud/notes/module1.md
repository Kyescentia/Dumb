# **Module 1: Cloud Concepts Overview**

#### **Section 1: Introduction to Cloud Computing**
* **Definition:** Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
* **Infrastructure as Software:** It allows users to treat infrastructure as software, which is flexible and can change quickly, rather than hardware, which requires physical space, staff, and long procurement cycles.
* **Cloud Service Models:**
    * **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** Provides the most control over IT resources (e.g., Amazon EC2).
    * **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** Removes the need to manage underlying infrastructure (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk).
    * **SaaS (Software as a Service):** Completed products run and managed by the service provider (e.g., email services).
* **Deployment Models:**
    * **Cloud:** All-in-cloud deployment.
    * **Hybrid:** Connects cloud resources to on-premises infrastructure.
    * **On-premises (Private Cloud):** Deployed locally using virtualization and resource management tools.

#### **Section 2: Advantages of Cloud Computing**
1.  **Trade capital expense for variable expense:** Pay only for what you consume instead of investing heavily in data centers.
2.  **Benefit from massive economies of scale:** Aggregated usage across customers leads to lower pay-as-you-go prices.
3.  **Stop guessing capacity:** Access as much or as little capacity as needed, scaling up or down automatically, avoiding over-provisioning or under-provisioning.
4.  **Increase speed and agility:** Reduce time to make resources available from weeks to minutes.
5.  **Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers:** Focus on business and customers rather than racking, stacking, and powering servers.
6.  **Go global in minutes:** Deploy apps in multiple regions around the world with low latency.

#### **Section 3: Introduction to AWS**
* **Web Service:** Software available over the internet using standardized formats like XML or JSON for API interactions.
* **AWS Definition:** A secure cloud platform offering a broad set of global cloud-based products (compute, storage, database, etc.).
* **Service Categories:** Includes Compute, Storage, Database, Networking, Security, Analytics, and more.
* **Interaction Methods:**
    * **AWS Management Console:** Graphical user interface.
    * **AWS Command Line Interface (CLI):** Command-line tool for scripts.
    * **Software Development Kits (SDKs):** Access services directly via code (Java, Python, etc.).

#### **Section 4: AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)**
* **Purpose:** Guidance to help organizations build a comprehensive approach to cloud computing throughout the IT lifecycle.
* **Six Perspectives:**
    * **Business:** IT finance, strategy, benefits realization, risk management.
    * **People:** Resource management, incentive management, career management, training, organizational change.
    * **Governance:** Portfolio management, program/project management, performance measurement, license management.
    * **Platform:** Compute, network, storage, database provisioning, solution architecture.
    * **Security:** IAM, detective control, infrastructure security, data protection, incident response.
    * **Operations:** Service monitoring, performance monitoring, resource inventory, release management.
