#### **Chapter Outline**
*   Introduction to Intellectual Property.
*   Intellectual Property rights.
*   Types of Intellectual Property.
*   Issues Related to Intellectual Property.

#### **Introduction to IP**
*   **Intellectual Property (IP)** refers to creations of the mind: inventions, literary and artistic works, and symbols, names, images, and designs used in commerce.
*   Businesses must understand how to use, protect, and uphold their IP rights.
*   It is essential for a company to extract income from its IP and prevent others from doing so.
*   Although IP is an intangible asset, it can be more costly than a company's physical assets and may offer a strategic advantage, so it must be carefully guarded.

#### **Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)**
*   **IPR** are rights derived from human intellectual activities that have economic benefits. They arise from the human brain's thinking that produces a useful product or process.
*   Copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and trademarks are the most popular IPRs.
*   IP includes ideas, innovations, industrial buildings, patents, music, literature, symbols, and other items produced by the human intellect.
*   IPR enables the proprietor to benefit from their product and gives them the right to prevent others from using it without permission. They have the legal right to sue for losses incurred.

#### **Types of Intellectual Property**
*   Patents
*   Trademarks
*   Copyrights and related rights
*   Trade secrets

*   **1. Patents**
    *   A patent is a license given to an author for their product, enabling them to commercialize it exclusively for a fixed amount of time.
    *   Any fresh and beneficial thing is called an "innovation."
    *   In Malaysia, patent protection is governed by the **Patents Act 1983** and the **Patents Regulations 1986**.
    *   An invention is patentable if it is new, involves an inventive step, and is industrially applicable.
    *   A patent expires **15 years** after the date of its grant. The owner has the right to exploit, assign, or license the patented invention.

*   **2. Trademarks**
    *   A trademark is a sign capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one enterprise from those of others.
    *   The **Trademarks Act 2019** in Malaysia provides for the registration of trademarks.
    *   There are **5 spectrums of trademark** based on strength or distinctiveness:
        1.  **Generic:** A common term associated with a product (e.g., CLOCK for a clock). Highly difficult or impossible to register. (Weakest)
        2.  **Descriptive:** Directly identifies the nature of the product (e.g., COLD AND CREAMY for ice cream).
        3.  **Suggestive:** Indicates some quality but doesn't directly describe the product (e.g., SWEETARTS for candy). (Neutral)
        4.  **Arbitrary:** Has a common meaning but is applied to an unrelated product (e.g., BLACKBERRY for a phone).
        5.  **Fanciful/Coined:** Has no meaning other than as a trademark (e.g., KODAK). Easiest to register and enforce. (Strongest)
    *   Despite wider awareness, trademark and copyright infringement still occur.

*   **3. Copyrights and related rights**
    *   **Copyright** is the legal right of a creator to commercially exploit their original work and prevent it from being reproduced without consent.
    *   The **Malaysia Copyright Act 1987** is the primary legislation governing copyright protection in Malaysia. It is based on international standards like the Berne Convention.
    *   The consolidated version includes amendments up to the **Copyright (Amendment) Act 2012**.
    *   The **Malaysian Copyright (Amendment) Act 2022** aims to comply with international agreements and strengthen enforcement, especially in the digital environment (e.g., offenses involving streaming technology).
    *   **How long does copyright protection last?**
        *   In Singapore, the US, and the EU, it lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years.
        *   In Malaysia, it lasts for the life of the creator plus 50 years after their death.
        *   After the copyright expires, the work enters the public domain.
    *   **Advantages of copyright protection:**
        *   Encourages human imagination and innovation by providing recognition and monetary compensation.
        *   Helps businesses in the production and distribution of works, promoting economic and social development.

*   **4. Trade secrets**
    *   Trade secrets are IP rights on confidential information that gives a business a competitive advantage.
    *   They can include technical information (e.g., research data, source code) and commercial information (e.g., marketing strategy).
    *   In Malaysia, 'trade secrets' is interchangeable with **'confidential information'**.
    *   Trade secrets are **not eligible to be registered** in Malaysia, but legal action can be taken if they are exploited.
    *   Statutory laws that provide indirect protection:
        *   **Competition Act 2010:** Prohibits anti-competitive behavior, including the misuse of trade secrets.
        *   **Malaysian Penal Code:** Sections on criminal breach of trust may apply.
    *   Legal mechanisms under contract law, common law, and statutory laws provide effective protection.
    *   **Measures to protect trade secrets:**
        *   **Internal:** Strengthen employee agreements, implement access controls, address everyday practices.
        *   **External:** Non-disclosure agreements (NDAs).

#### **Issues Related to Intellectual Property**
*   **1. Plagiarism:** Stealing someone else's thoughts or vocabulary and claiming them as one's own, such as by cutting and pasting without attribution. It is a major issue among writers, singers, and even software developers. It's a problem at all stages of education, with some students having little understanding of what it is.
*   **2. Reverse Engineering:** The method of examining a commercially accessible commodity to ascertain its structure, technology, and other features. A rival can discover production and design secrets through this process. In Malaysia, there are no specific laws that directly prohibit reverse engineering, but it can be indirectly restricted by the Copyright Act 1987, Patents Act 1983, trade secrets law, and End-User License Agreements (EULA).
*   **3. Open Source Code:**
    *   **Open-source software** has publicly available source code that can be accessed, modified, and redistributed. Google Chrome and Netflix are based on open-source technologies.
    *   **Closed source software** source codes are not disclosed to the public or are disclosed under strict confidentiality conditions.
    *   Open-source software is a robust resource because it is publicly distributed and reviewed. It's important to research the license terms before using it.
*   **4. Competitive Intelligence (CI):** The process of discovering, analyzing, and gathering patent and market data to gain insight into the industry's progress, competitors' strategies, and to identify business risks and opportunities. CI plays a critical role in the IPR domain.
*   **5. Trademark Infringement:** The illegal use of a trademark or service mark, which can lead to disinformation or uncertainty about the true source of a product. Trademark owners can file a lawsuit, and if misuse is proven, a court may grant an injunction and monetary compensation.
*   **6. Cyber Squatting:** The process of registering internet domains that are identical or close to a third-party business name or trademark to benefit from their goodwill or to resell the domain for a profit. The aim can be to transfer the domain back to the owner, profit from goodwill, or for criminal activities like phishing.
    *   **Types of Cybersquatting:**
        *   **Identity theft:** An attacker registers a domain that looks identical to a legitimate business to create a phishing site.
        *   **Name jacking:** Creating a false website or social media profile using the real name of a famous person.
        *   **Typosquatting:** Registering misspelled versions of popular domain names (e.g., Googgle.com instead of Google.com).
        *   **Reverse-cybersquatting:** A hacker incorporates under the same name as an established website and then claims the genuine owner is squatting on their name to try to take possession of the website.
