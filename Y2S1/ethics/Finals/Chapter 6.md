#### **1. General Security Risk Assessment**
*   A **risk assessment** is a method for determining the security risks an organization's systems and networks face from internal and external threats.
*   The goal of risk management is to determine how to best use time and capital to defend against the most significant threats.
*   An **asset** is any hardware, software, computer system, network, or database used to achieve business goals.
*   A **failure case** is any event with a detrimental effect on an asset, such as a virus infection or a DDoS attack.

*   **Steps in a General Security Risk Evaluation Process:**
    1.  **Identify Assets:** Identify the IT properties the company is most worried about, prioritizing those key to business objectives.
    2.  **Specify Loss Events:** Identify potential loss cases, risks, and threats (e.g., DDoS attack, insider theft).
    3.  **Frequency of Events:** Estimate the probability of each threat.
    4.  **Impact of Events:** Determine the severity of each hazard.
        *   **Risk Tolerance Level = Probability x Impact**
    5.  **Options to Mitigate:** Decide if each hazard can be mitigated to be less likely or have a smaller impact. Organizations often focus on risks with high frequency and high impact.
    6.  **Feasibility of Options:** Evaluate the viability of putting mitigation options into action.
    7.  **Cost/Benefit Analysis:** Conduct a study to ensure the activities are profitable and that the cost of control does not outweigh the system's benefits.
    8.  **Decision:** Determine whether to implement a particular countermeasure. If not, consider if the threat is serious enough to warrant a less costly option.

*   **Examples of Risk Analysis:**
    *   **Scenario 1:** A database with publicly available information has low security controls.
        *   **Probability of data breach:** High.
        *   **Impact of data breach:** Non-critical.
        *   **Decision:** Accept the risk with current security controls.
    *   **Scenario 2:** A database with sensitive customer information has very high security controls.
        *   **Probability of data breach:** Low.
        *   **Impact of data breach:** Critical (reputational damage, legal lawsuits, financial losses).
        *   **Decision:** Prioritize the risk and take all necessary actions to prevent it.

#### **2. Trustworthy Computing**
*   **Trustworthy computing** is an approach that provides stable, confidential, and consistent computing interactions based on sound market practices. It is a top priority for the computer industry.
*   Microsoft, for example, has committed to a trustworthy programming campaign.
*   The four pillars of Trustworthy Computing are:
    1.  **Security:** The system is resilient to attack, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its data are protected.
    2.  **Privacy:** People can control their personal information, and organizations that use it protect it faithfully.
    3.  **Reliability:** The computer system is dependable, available when needed, and performs as expected.
    4.  **Business Integrity:** Companies are responsible to customers, help them find appropriate solutions, address problems with products or services, and are open in their interactions.

#### **3. CIA Triad**
*   **Confidentiality:** Only approved individuals can access sensitive information. This can be achieved through tools like encryption and physical security (e.g., door locks).
*   **Integrity:** Ensures that information is correct and has not been altered by an unauthorized person or malicious software. For example, preventing an attacker from changing the price of an online purchase.
*   **Availability:** Designated users have constant access to assets. Data is accessible to authorized users when needed.

#### **4. IT Security Policy**
*   An **IT Security Policy** is a written document stating how an organization plans to protect its IT assets.
*   **Examples of IT Security Policies:**
    *   **Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):** Provides users with clear direction on the permissible uses of information resources.
    *   **Information Security Policy:** Provides high-level guidance for the security program.
    *   **Incident Response Policy:** Describes how the organization will respond to security incidents.
    *   **Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Policy:** Outlines procedures to ensure essential business functions continue during and after a disaster.
    *   **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Policy:** Establishes standards for maintaining software, ensuring security is integrated at every stage.
    *   **Change Management and Change Control Policy:** Describes how the organization will review, approve, and implement changes to information systems.

#### **5. International Organization for Standardization (ISO)**
*   The **ISO** has created a wide array of cybersecurity standards.
*   **ISO 27001** is a standard that provides requirements for an **information security management system (ISMS)**. An ISMS is a systematic approach to managing sensitive assets (people, processes, and IT systems) to keep them secure.
*   **ISO 27001 includes control objectives covering 14 categories:**
    *   Information Security Policies
    *   Organization of information security
    *   Human resource security
    *   Asset Management
    *   Access Control
    *   Cryptography
    *   Physical and environmental security
    *   Operation Security
    *   Communications Security
    *   System acquisition, development and maintenance
    *   Supplier relationships
    *   Information security incident management
    *   Information security aspects of business continuity management
    *   Compliance with internal and external requirements (e.g., laws).

#### **6. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)**
*   **NIST** is a U.S. Commerce Department agency that promotes U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness.
*   NIST created the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**, a set of guidelines for private companies to identify, detect, and respond to cyberattacks. The latest version is **NIST CSF 2.0**.
*   The NIST CSF is divided into three basic parts:
    1.  **CSF Core:** Defines the activities needed to achieve cybersecurity outcomes. It consists of Functions, Categories, and Subcategories. The six functions are: Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.
    2.  **CSF Organizational Profiles:** Relate to the current status of an organization's cybersecurity measures and provide a "road map" toward compliance.
        *   A **Current Profile** specifies the outcomes an organization is currently achieving.
        *   A **Target Profile** specifies the desired outcomes for achieving cybersecurity risk management objectives.
        *   Steps for creating a profile include scoping, gathering information, creating the profile, analyzing gaps, and implementing an action plan.
    3.  **CSF Tiers:** Four tiers help organizations identify their level of compliance. The higher the tier, the more compliant the organization.
        *   **Tier 1:** Partial
        *   **Tier 2:** Risk-Informed
        *   **Tier 3:** Repeatable
        *   **Tier 4:** Adaptive
