### **Chapter 9: VPN and IPsec Concepts**

This chapter covers the technologies used to create secure network connections over public infrastructure.

#### **9.1-9.2 VPN Technology and Types**

*   **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**: A technology that creates a secure, encrypted connection (a "tunnel") over a public network like the internet.
*   **Benefits**: Cost savings, security, scalability, and compatibility.
*   **Types of VPNs**:
    *   **Remote Access VPN**: Connects a single user to a corporate network. Can be client-based (requires software) or clientless (uses a web browser/SSL).
    *   **Site-to-Site VPN**: Connects two or more entire networks together (e.g., branch office to headquarters).
*   **VPN Technologies**:
    *   **IPsec**: A robust framework for providing security at the network layer. Commonly used for both remote access and site-to-site VPNs.
    *   **SSL/TLS**: Often used for clientless remote access VPNs directly through a web browser.
    *   **GRE over IPsec**: Encapsulates Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) packets within IPsec. This allows multicast traffic (like routing protocol updates) to be sent securely over a VPN, which IPsec alone cannot do.
    *   **DMVPN (Dynamic Multipoint VPN)**: A Cisco solution that simplifies the creation of a large number of site-to-site tunnels in a hub-and-spoke topology, with the ability to create dynamic spoke-to-spoke tunnels.

#### **9.3 IPsec**

*   **IPsec Framework**: An IETF standard that provides confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and secure key exchange.
*   **Key Components**:
    *   **Confidentiality (Encryption)**: Provided by algorithms like AES (preferred) and 3DES.
    *   **Integrity (Hashing)**: Ensures data is not modified in transit, using algorithms like SHA (preferred) and MD5.
    *   **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of the peers, using either a Pre-Shared Key (PSK) or digital certificates (RSA).
    *   **Key Exchange**: The Diffie-Hellman (DH) algorithm is used to securely exchange keys over an insecure channel. Higher DH group numbers are more secure.
*   **IPsec Protocols**:
    *   **Authentication Header (AH)**: Provides integrity and authentication, but **no encryption**.
    *   **Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)**: Provides integrity, authentication, **and encryption**. This is the most commonly used protocol.
