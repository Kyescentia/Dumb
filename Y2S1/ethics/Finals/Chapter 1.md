#### **Definition of Ethics**
*   **Ethics** is a set of values that define what is and is not acceptable behaviour in a certain society.
*   **Computer ethics** are guidelines for the morally acceptable use of computers in society.
*   Ethical behaviour is described by a set of widely agreed standards, many of which are almost universal. For example, lying and stealing are immoral.
*   Opinions on what constitutes ethical action differ dramatically. For instance, software piracy (making unauthorized copies of software) is considered ethical in some countries but not in others. The presentation includes a world map showing the "Top 20 Software License Misuse and Piracy Hotspots," with China, Russia, and the United States listed as the top three.
*   People often build patterns to distinguish between what their culture finds good and poor.
*   A **virtue** is a habit that encourages people to do what is right, while a **sin** is a habit that encourages people to do what is wrong.
*   Virtues include fairness and honesty, while vices include envy and rage.
*   Ethics is a subset of philosophy concerned with principles of human behavior, specifically the rightness and wrongness of actions and the goodness and badness of intentions.

#### **Ethical Consideration in Decision Making**
*   The steps involved in ethical decision making are:
    1.  **Develop Problem Statement:** A succinct, straightforward explanation of the problem to be solved.
    2.  **Identify Alternatives:** Engage stakeholders to find multiple alternative solutions.
    3.  **Evaluate & Choose Alternative:** Test alternatives using metrics like efficacy, risk, cost, and implementation time.
    4.  **Implement Decision:** Execute the chosen solution in a timely, reliable, and effective manner.
    5.  **Evaluate Results:** Track the outcome to see if the desired consequence was achieved and observe the effects on the company and stakeholders.
*   Most ethical choices involve:
    *   Several options
    *   Long-term consequences
    *   Unpredictable outcomes
    *   Outcomes that combine different fiscal, legal, and social advantages and costs
    *   Personal ramifications
*   Organizational ethics decisions require deep consideration, weighing economic and self-interest benefits against legal, ethical, and social benefits and costs.

#### **Difference between Moral, Ethics and Laws**
*   **Morals:** Refer to one's religious views on what is right and wrong. A moral action aligns with an individual's belief in the right thing to do. Laws may permit acts that some people consider immoral (e.g., abortion).
*   **Ethics:** Refers to the rules or codes of conduct that a society (nation, institution, or profession) expects of an individual. For example, the legal profession's principles require lawyers to defend a client to the best of their ability, even if they know the client is guilty.
*   **Law:** A set of rules that determines what we are permitted and not permitted to do.
*   A Venn diagram illustrates that some actions can be ethical, moral, and legal (EML), while others might fall into combinations like just ethical and moral (EM), ethical and legal (EL), or moral and legal (ML).

#### **Requirement of Ethics in Information Technology**
*   The implementation of information systems is intertwined with social and political affairs, making ethical considerations crucial.
*   Electronic devices have infiltrated all aspects of governance, work, and personal life.
*   **Electronic knowledge system ethical issues** include the regulation of electronic records, access to information, privacy, data manipulation, and international implications, particularly concerning computer networks and electronic databases.
*   **Privacy policies for computer ethics** address concerns such as employees' personal use of company computers. While many employees have work email, they may also use business computers for personal messages.
*   New technologies allow for monitoring not just email but also other internet activities like message boards and web browsing. Businesses may track network traffic to ensure productivity and prevent ethical lapses, but it's difficult to determine the motivation behind visiting a website just from the visit itself.
*   The proliferation of the internet and the ability to collect and retain large volumes of personal information have increased the potential for unethical use of IT.

*   **Scenarios that raise public concern:**
    *   **Tracking employee email and Internet usage:** Managers track usage to control productivity.
    *   **Downloading of free music and movies:** Often in breach of copyright laws, causing significant costs to copyright owners.
    *   **Spamming:** Unsolicited emails used as a low-cost communication strategy.
    *   **Hackers and identity fraud:** Gaining access to financial and retail records to commit fraud.
    *   **Plagiarism:** Copying material from the internet for term papers.
    *   **Cookies and spyware:** Websites placing these on hard drives to log users' online activities.

#### **Ethics for IT Professionals**
*   The IT industry is one of the world's fastest-developing and most diverse industries.
*   IT professionals work in various fields, including education, networking, entertainment, medicine, and security.
*   **Characteristics of a good tech career:**
    *   **Patience:** Requires continuous analysis and trial-and-error.
    *   **Able to communicate effectively:** Must be clear and concise with different types of clients.
    *   **Able to adapt quickly:** The IT field is constantly changing.
    *   **Multitasking:** Should be able to handle several tasks at once.
    *   **Problem-solving ability:** Need to use their own methods and scientific skills.
    *   **Excited about the job:** Willing to learn more about the industry and apply new knowledge.
*   **Professionals** are described by the US Code of Federal Regulations as meeting four criteria:
    1.  Work requires advanced expertise in science or engineering.
    2.  The work is unique and imaginative in a recognized artistic field.
    3.  Consistent application of discretion and judgment.
    4.  Work is mostly intellectual and cannot be standardized over a specific time frame.
*   Professionals are expected to engage in lifelong learning and contribute to society.
*   A **professional code of ethics** outlines the ideals and standards of an occupational group, typically divided into two sections: the organization's goals and the guidelines for all members.
*   **Advantages of adhering to a professional code of ethics:**
    *   **Ethical decision-making:** Based on shared core principles.
    *   **High ethical principles and practice:** Reminds professionals of their responsibilities.
    *   **Public interest and confidence:** Builds trust in the practitioner's honesty and judgment.
    *   **Self-evaluation benchmark:** Serves as a standard for professionals and their peers.

*   **Seven trends are reshaping the professional services industry:**
    *   **Client sophistication:** Clients are more aware of their needs and negotiate for better services.
    *   **Governance:** Stricter legislation (e.g., Sarbanes-Oxley Act) has led to less confidence and more oversight.
    *   **Interconnectedness:** Business ties rely on easy and quick communication.
    *   **Discretion:** Clients want to monitor work-in-progress in real time.
    *   **Modularization:** Clients deconstruct business processes to handle some directly and outsource others.
    *   **Globalization:** A wide range of service providers worldwide makes the market highly competitive.
    *   **Commoditization:** Low-end services are often chosen based on price, while clients seek partnerships for high-end offerings.

#### **Common Ethical Issues for IT Users**
*   **Software Piracy:** In a business setting, this can often be traced back to IT experts. Corporate IT policies should enable users to report piracy.
*   **Inappropriate use of computing resources:** Employees using company laptops for personal websites, chat rooms, or games consumes resources and reduces productivity. Sharing inappropriate content can lead to charges of a hostile work environment.
*   **Inappropriate sharing of information:**
    *   Businesses handle large volumes of private or confidential data, including employee wage information, health records, and consumer payment details.
    *   Accidentally sharing this information with an unauthorized party can compromise privacy or leak business secrets to rivals.
*   **Establishing an IT use policy:**
    *   **Establishing guidelines for use of company software:** Provide specific rules for personal computer and application usage.
    *   **Defining and limiting the appropriate use of IT resources:** Encourage respect for company resources and enforce written standards.
    *   **Structuring information systems to protect data and information:** Limit data access to only those employees who need it.

#### **Certifications**
*   A certificate is awarded by a certifying body to a practitioner with a certain range of talents, expertise, or ability.
*   Certifications are offered by various corporations and educational associations.
*   Employers often see them as a measure of mastery of fundamental skills, but some hiring managers are skeptical as they are no substitute for experience.
*   Most IT professionals seek certifications to improve their skills and qualifications, which can boost salary and career prospects.
*   **Vendors certification:** Offered by industry vendors to train IT professionals on their products (e.g., CISCO, Microsoft, AWS).
*   **Industry association certification:** Often require more expertise than vendor certifications and are shifting towards a mix of academic, industry, and behavioral competencies (e.g., (ISC)², ISACA).
*   Individuals seeking certification typically need to have the necessary qualifications, pass an exam, and adhere to a code of ethics.
*   Entry-level IT certifications can help launch a career.
