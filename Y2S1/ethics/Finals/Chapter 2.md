#### **1. Introduction to Cybercrime**
*   **Cybercrime** is a form of illegal activity that takes place over the Internet, using modern technology. It is an unlawful Internet operation where a device is used as a weapon, a goal, or both.
*   Cybercrime can be classified into two types:
    *   Those that cause **malicious harm**.
    *   Those that cause **accidental harm**.
*   It encompasses a broad variety of destructive behavior.
*   **Examples of cybercrime:**
    *   **Illegal entry, illegal intrusion, and computer abuse:** Offenses against IT infrastructure.
    *   **Data theft**
    *   **Cyberbullying:** Poses a danger to a person's physical protection through force, threats, or manipulation. It can also show hatred or discrimination toward protected groups.
    *   **Distribution of worms or viruses**
    *   **Hacking:** For the intent of obtaining financial or personal details.
    *   **Unintentional damage:** For example, a dissatisfied employee creates a "harmless" virus that causes company disruption, leading to financial impact from wasted work hours and resources spent on correction.

#### **2. Computer User Expectations**
*   Computer technology makes it **faster and less costly to capture more data** than was previously possible on paper. Electronic technology allows for capturing a greater variety of documents.
*   Transactions and information are fine-grained, making it possible to **record and preserve all individual modifications** to a file.
*   Content/document management systems track any person who "touches" (creates, shows, copies, or modifies) a record, which can result in very large audit trail metadata.
*   The **efficient resolution of computer issues is crucial** for users. This pressure on tech assistance desks can lead to delays in verifying user identities or permissions.
*   Users often share login credentials, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
*   **Factors contributing to a spike in computer-related vulnerability incidents:**
    *   **Vulnerability rises as complexity rises:** The computational world is complex, with millions of lines of code connecting computers, networks, and software. More connected devices mean more potential entry points for security breaches.
    *   Keeping up with the **speed of technical change** and evaluating new security challenges is extremely difficult.

#### **3. Reliance on Commercial Software**
*   An **exploit** is a computer attack that **takes advantage of a flaw** in a system, often caused by poor system design or implementation.
*   When a security flaw is found, software engineers release a "fix," or **patch**, to remedy the problem. If a patch is not installed, the user risks a security breach.

#### **4. Security Attacks**
*   There are two main types of security attacks:
    1.  **Passive attacks**
    2.  **Active attacks**

*   **Passive Attacks:**
    *   Attempts to acquire information from a system **without harming** its resources. The goal is to **intercept information**.
    *   The focus is on **avoidance** rather than detection.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   **Eavesdropping:** Secretly listening to a conversation or communication.
        *   **Traffic monitoring:** Monitoring the location, identity, frequency, and duration of messages. This is difficult to detect as it doesn't change the data. Cryptography can help prevent it.

*   **Active Attacks:**
    *   Involves **tampering with the data stream or creating a fake stream**.
    *   **Four groups of active attacks:**
        1.  **Masquerade:** One person pretends to be another to gain more privileges.
        2.  **Replay:** Passively recording data and retransmitting it to achieve an unauthorized result.
        3.  **Message alteration:** Altering, delaying, or reordering a legitimate message.
        4.  **Denial-of-service (DoS):** Flooding a system with fake requests to make it unavailable.

*   **Types of Active Attacks (Malware):**
    *   **Virus:** A piece of computer code that causes a system to behave in an unexpected and unpleasant manner. Most carry a "payload" (malicious content). They spread through user actions like opening infected attachments and can range from irritating to destructive, even causing DoS situations.
        *   **Example: Macro virus:** Corrupts documents with a program written in an application's macro language (e.g., VBScript). It infects the application and inserts itself into all subsequent documents.
    *   **Worms:** Harmful software that duplicates itself in a computer's active memory. Unlike viruses, they can **transmit without the aid of people**, sometimes by emailing copies of themselves. They are standalone programs that exploit flaws or use social engineering to spread.
    *   **Trojan Horse:** Disguises itself as a genuine application to trick users into installing it. It then harms data or the network but **cannot reproduce itself**.
    *   **Botnet:** A collection of internet-connected computers infected with malware and controlled by hackers. Cybercriminals use Trojan viruses to infect these computers and install command-and-control software.
    *   **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) Attack:** A coordinated attempt to disrupt a server or network by overwhelming it with internet traffic from a large number of compromised machines (a botnet). The individual machines are called bots or zombies. It is difficult to distinguish DDoS traffic from regular traffic.
    *   **Rootkit:** A collection of software tools that allows a threat actor to remotely access and manipulate a device. It can be used to execute programs, access logs, and monitor user activity.
    *   **Spam:** Unrequested, usually promotional, messages sent to a large number of people.
        *   **Types of Spam:** Email spam, social media spam (via fake profiles), mobile phone spam (SMS or push alerts), text message spam (via instant messaging apps), and SEO spam (using SEO to boost a spammer's website in search results).
    *   **Phishing:** A social engineering attack to obtain sensitive information like passwords and credit card details.
        *   **Social Engineering:** A hacker acts as a trustworthy person to convince a victim to perform an action.
        *   **Phishing Techniques:**
            *   **Email Scams:** Phishing emails mimic legitimate businesses, using the same wording and fonts. They often create a sense of urgency and use misspelled domain names in links.
            *   **Spear Phishing:** Targets a single individual or business, requiring in-depth knowledge of the target.
        *   **Life cycle of a phishing kit:** 1. A legitimate website is cloned. 2. The login page is changed to a credential-stealing script. 3. The modified files are bundled into a zip file (the phishing kit). 4. The kit is uploaded to a hacked website and unzipped. 5. Emails with links to the new spoofed website are sent to victims.

#### **5. Hackers and Crackers**
*   **Ethical Hackers (White-hat hackers):**
    *   Explore the limits of computer networks to learn and improve security. They have a clear knowledge of IT and security features.
    *   They hold valid licenses (e.g., CEH certificates) and use their skills to test a network's security and vulnerabilities for a company.
*   **Crackers (Malicious Hackers or Black-hat hackers):**
    *   Maliciously hack into remote computers to compromise their functionality.
    *   They destroy vital records, deny service, or create other issues after gaining unauthorized access.
    *   They are corrupt and aim to profit from illegal activities, often by erasing or harming records when they find a loophole.

#### **6. Malicious Insider**
*   A current or former employee, contractor, or business partner who **intentionally misuses their authorized access** to an organization's network, system, or data.
*   This misuse jeopardizes the data's confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
*   These frauds often require coordination between the insider and a third party.

#### **7. Cybercriminals**
*   Motivated by **financial gain** to break into business servers, often by transferring funds between accounts.
*   They steal and resell credit card numbers, personal names, and mobile phone IDs. They may pay for technological skills or access from dishonest insiders.
*   **Hacktivists:**
    *   Use malware to accomplish a **political or social objective**.
    *   They use computer-based assaults to advance their agendas or threaten a country.
*   **Cyber terrorists:**
    *   Have more radical aims than hacktivists.
    *   They employ tactics to **kill or interrupt networks to inflict damage**, rather than just collect intelligence.
    *   For example, hacking into critical infrastructure like dams or air traffic control networks. However, there has not yet been a single case of true cyber terrorism.
